# REACT-Google-Book-Search

## Overview
This was an assignment for my coding bootcamp.  It was designed to be a MongoDB Single Page Application.  This is accomplished through the use of react-router-dom, which hides and shows React components based on user actions.  It is a full MERN stack application.

## NPM Packages
Mongoose, axios, react-router-dom

## How it works
Users enter the tite of a book that they would like to search for on the Google Books API.  The API returns the Title(with link to the book), author(s), synopsis, and thumbnail.  The user can then save the book and it will save to a database.  This saved information can be retrieved by the user and then deleted.
